# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

A ride sharing app called PyBer is looking for data analysis for city types and average city type fares. V. Isualize, the boss at PyBer, would like to see a break down by week. In addition we've provided a breakdown by city type (rural, suburban, urban) displaying total rides and drivers along with total fares and averages per ride and driver. PyBer wants this data for the purpose of highlighting areas that might need adjustments. Looking at the data we can see what if any changes are viable.

## Results

### PyBer Results

- Rural - The total rides and drivers in rural areas are among the lowest of all three city types. The average fare per ride is about $20 higher than the average fare per driver. Both the average fare per diver and per ride are the highests of the three city types.
- Suburban - The average fare per ride is about $9 dollars less that the average fare per driver. Just like in the rural areas, the total rides are larger than the total drivers.
- Urban - The urban area is the only city type that has a higher number of total drivers than the total number of rides. The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is the lowest of all the city types.

### PyBer Fare Results

- Rual fares are by far the highest for each week of all city types
- All three city type's fares jump up during the last week of February and then dip in early March.
- Across all city types the week with the lowest fare total occur in January.
- The highest total fare in the urban areas occur in last week of February.

## Summary

As we see in the data the urban areas have a much lower average fare per ride and average fare per driver while at the same time having way more drivers than rides. Beefing up advertising and promos in urban areas might generate rides. This is especially in throughout January and early February when total fare amounts are low.

In rural areas total drivers are low which could affect demand. We could recruit more drivers which would provide wider availibility and lead to additional rides.

Similarly we see there are fewer drivers than there are rides in suburban areas. Having promotions in March could help boost weekly fare totals when we see fares somewhat stagnant or low for suburban areas.
