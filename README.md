# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

A ride sharing app called PyBer is looking for data analysis in city types on average city fares. V. Isualize, the boss at PyBer, would like to see break down by week. In addition we've provided to breakdown by city type (rural, suburban, urban) displaying total rides and drivers along with total fares and averages per ride and driver. PyBer wants this data for the purpose of highlighting areas that might need adjustments. Looking at the data we can see what if any changes are viable.
